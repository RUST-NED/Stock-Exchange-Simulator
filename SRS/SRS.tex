	\chapter {Overall Description}
	\section {Product Perspective}

	Stock Exchange Simulator is an application for users to learn about stock exchanging without risking real money. This document covers the requirements for the first version (Version 1.0) of the application.
	
	\section {Product Functionality} 

	Following are the major functionalities of this project:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Users will be able to sign up for a new account.
		\item Users will be able to sign in using an existing account.
		\item Users will be able to view their portfolio including all their stock holdings (and details therof) and cash.
		\item Users will be able to view details of the stocks they have selected to be tracked.
		\item Users will be able to see history of their trading.
		\item Users will be able to find out price of any stock by inputting the stock's symbol or company name.
		\item Users will be able to "buy" any amount of any stock they want (provided they have enough cash).
		\item Users will be able to "sell" any of their stocks.
		\item Users will be able to view a leaderboard of all users of the application. (leaderboard ranks users by their total value)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section {Users and Characteristics}
	
	This application only has one category of user: an end user.
	
	\subsection{End User}
	The end user is the one who wants to learn stock trading and/or practice trading stress-free with no risk of losing actual money. They should be able to perform all functionalities as mentioned in the Product Functionality section above.
	
	\section {Operating Environment}

	The application is desktop-based and version 1.0 would work on \textbf{Microsoft Windows}, since the initial development would be done on computers running Windows. Later versions of the application would support other major desktop OS's like MacOS and Linux. The targeted Windows versions are Windows 10 and above. The application would require \textbf{a stable connection to the internet} because stock prices are fetched through an API and the backend is managed by google Firebase, both of which require an internet connection. The API that will be used to get stocks related data is Alpha Vantage API (https://www.alphavantage.co/).
	
	\section {Design and Implementation Constraints}
	
	\subsection{API usage limit}
	Version 1.0 would be using the free version of the Alpha Vantage API, which limits 5 API requests per minute and 500 requests per day for an API key. This API usage limit must be kept in mind while developing the application as trying to access the API at a higher frequency than the specified limits would not give the required results, and so proper error handling must be done.
	
	\subsection{Firebase Constraints}
	The application will use firebase for its backend. If firebase functionality isn't available at any time then the application won't work. Also, firebase's free version has limits like database access limits, so those must be kept in mind by the developer.
	
	\subsection{Internet Connectivity}
	As the application will use a third party API and Google Firebase, an internet connection is necessary for the application to work.
	
	\subsection{Hardware Constraints}
	To run this application, a computer with a mouse and keyboard is required. Since the development IDE is quite lightweight, a minimum RAM of 4 GB and a minimum disk space of 15 GB would suffice.
	
	\subsection{OS Constraint (Windows only)}
	As already highlighted, version 1.0 is targeted for Windows, specifically Windows 10 and above. Therefore computer's running windows 10 or above would be required for development of the application.

	
	\section {User Documentation}
	
	The software would come with a user manual which would include the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basics of stocks and stock exchange.
		\item Guide on how to navigate and use the application.
		\item Guide on how to get a free (or premium (paid), if user desires) Alpha Vantage API key.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section {Assumptions and Dependencies}
	
	\subsection{Alphavantage API}
	It is assumed that the Alphavantage API would be working correctly and respond fast all the time as the API is an important factor in many functionalities of the app. It is also assumed that any user won't be using the app in such a way that it exceeds the API limits of Alphavantage (which should be sufficient for most use cases). Moreover the API may change in terms of its syntax, functions, features, etc.

	\subsection{Firebase}
	Similarly it is assumed that firebase's services like authentication and database won't be down at any time. Moreover it is assumed that functionality limits of firebase won't be exceeded.
	
	\subsection{Computer}
	Although the application is not very CPU intensive, it is assumed that the application would be run on a computer with decent hardware specifications and a good internet connection.
	

	\chapter {Specific Requirements}
	\section {External Interface Requirements}
	\subsection {User Interfaces}
	%\textit{Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., Cancel) that will appear on every screen, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed.
%	TO DO: The least you can do for this section is to describe in words the different User Interfaces and the different screens that will be available to the user. Those who will be able to provide optional Graphical User Interface screenshots, will be rewarded by extra marks.}

	The application's user interfaces can be classified into 2 categories depending on authentication state; i.e: the interfaces available when not signed in and when signed in. The application's general layout is to look uniform and consistent, especially the header and navigation bar, regardless of authentication state.
	
	\subsubsection{When not signed in}
	When not signed in, the navigation bar should only have buttons for signing in and signing up.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Sign Up page:} A form for signing up with fields for \underline{name}, \underline{email address}, \underline{password}, \underline{confirm password}, and \underline{API key}, followed by a "Sign Up" button. and a simple guide on how to get an Alpha Vantage API.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{signin}
		\item \textbf{Sign In page:} A sign in form with fields for \underline{email address}, and \underline{password}.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{signup}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{When signed in}
	When signed in, all the main features of the applications are to be accessible. The navigation bar in this state should include buttons for dashboard, quote, buy, sell, history, and leaderboard.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Dashboard Page:} The main / home screen of the application showing a dashboard summarizing the user's performance. Firstly a table showing all stock holdings and cash would be shown. Next, data of the user's tracked stocks would  be shown.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{Dashboard}
		\item \textbf{Quote Page: } A page to get latest information about any stock. An input field for searching stock (that would give autocomplete suggestions) with name of company or symbol of stock should be present. When searched, stock's information should be provided in user friendly manner.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{quote1}
		\item \textbf{Buy}: A page to buy any stock. Input fields for symbol of stock and amount of stocks would be present.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{buy}
		\item \textbf{Sell}: A page to sell any of users stocks. Option to select a stock (drop-down) and specify amount to sell would be given.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{sell}
		\item \textbf{History}: A history of user's stock transaction in tabular form should be present.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{history}
		\item \textbf{Leaderboard}: Leaderboard showing a table of all users on the app ranked by their total value.\\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]{leaderboard}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection {Hardware Interfaces}
	This application is completely software based and has no hardware interfaces.
	
	\subsection {Software Interfaces}

%	\textit{Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems (Windows? Linux? Etc…), tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint. 
%	TO DO: The previous part illustrates some of the information you would usually include in this part of the SRS document. To make things simpler, you are only required to describe the specific interface with the operating system}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The operating system for version 1.0 is Microsoft Windows (version 10 and above)
		\item The application will use Firebase Auth for user authentication
		\item The database to be used is Firebase's FireStore.
		\item The application will use Alphavantage API to get latest stocks related information.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection {Communications Interfaces}

	The application will be communicating with Alphavantage API using HTTP requests. In addition to that it will be using firebase for backend services including authentication and database.
	
	\section {Functional Requirements}
	
	\subsection{General}
	The Application requires users to sign in to use its features. As such, the first screen visible should be the sign in screen with option to go to signup screen. Once signed in, the rest of the application should be accessible.
	Each user will be given an initial cash amount of \$10,000.
	\subsection{Sign Up}
	The Sign Up page should have a sign up form including fields for \underline{name}, \underline{email address}, \underline{password}, \underline{confirm password}, and \underline{API key}, followed by a "Sign Up" button. In addition to the form, a simple guide on how to get an Alpha Vantage API key should be present below the form. Constraints on password for version 1 are just that the password should atleast be of 4 characters. If valid data is entered, the user should be registered, signed in to the application, and navigated to the home screen. The data validation checks to be included are valid email address format, matching and valid passwords, and valid API key. If invalid data is entered however, appropriate error message(s) must be displayed.

	
	\subsection{Sign In}
	A similar layout to the Sign Up page should be displayed with the difference being in the fields of the form and no api key tutorial. The fields included should be \underline{email address} and \underline{password}. On successful sign in, the user should be redirected to home screen. On incorrect credentials, appropriate error message(s) must be displayed.

	
	\subsection{Home Screen (dashboard showing portfolio and tracked stocks)}
	This functional requirement covers product functionalities number 3 and 4 from section 2.2. The home screen of the application should show details of user's portfolio including information of their stocks and cash.

	\section {Behaviour Requirements}

	\subsection {Use Case View}

\includegraphics{usecase}
The actors are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unregistered Users} - Users who have not signed up yet or are signed up but do not sign in
\item \textbf{Registered Users} - Users who have signed up and are signed in.
\end{itemize}

The use cases are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sign Up} - Users sign up by providing their personal information on a registration page form.
\item \textbf{Sign In} - Users sign in by entering their username and password.
\item \textbf{Sign Out} - End signed in session so no one else accesses an account.
\item \textbf{See Stock Price} - View stock listings.
\item \textbf{Buy Stock} - Buy stock and add it to account.
\item \textbf{Sell Stock} - Sell stock already in account.
\item \textbf{View Dashboard or Portfolio} - Users view their stocks, their valuations and other statistics on a dashboard page.
\item \textbf{View Transaction History} - Users view their stock buying and selling history.
\item \textbf{View Leaderboard} - Users see all users along with their valuations and ranked accordingly.
\end{itemize}
	

	
	\chapter {Other Non-Functional Requirements}
	\section {Performance Requirements}

	\subsection{Application start-up time}
	The application should not take more than 10 seconds to load
	\subsection{Switching pages}
	The application should load any new page clicked on by the user in no more than 5 seconds
	\subsection{Authentication}
	Results of authentication (for example successful or failed sign-in or signup) should be obtained in no more than 5 seconds.
	\subsection{Stock price quote}
	Searching for a stock and getting its price from the quote page should not take more than 15 seconds
	\subsection{Buy/Sell Stocks Transactions}
	Result of buying and selling a stock should not take more than 10 seconds.
	
	
	\section {Safety and Security Requirements}
	\subsection{Safety Requirements}
	This product does not have any particular safety hazards other than the common problems associated with long periods of computer usage such as the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item eye strain / weakening of eyesight
		\item headaches
		\item postural issues and muscular imbalances
	\end{itemize}
	As such, it is the responsibility of the end user themself to avoid using the application for prolonged periods of time and take regular breaks.
	
	\subsection{Security Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Users' passwords must be stored safely and not leaked in any case
		\item Every user's data must be protected from tampering by any other user
	\end{itemize}
	Security related to authentication would be satisfied easily as Google's trusted Firebase system would be used for authentication. However for database security, the developers must design the Firestore database and define its security and access rules properly.
		
	\section {Software Quality Attributes}
	\subsection{Readability}
	The developers must ensure that the code they write is clean and highly readable, for ease of future development. Bad practices must be avoided. Clear and consise comments should be provided.
	\subsection{Maintainability}
	Although high readability would play a part in making the code maintainable, additional efforts must be made in this regard such as modularization of code as much as possible and making each module perform small independent tasks.
	\subsection{Adaptability}
	The code must be written in such a way that it can be easily adapted to changes in syntax, functionality, etc. of Firebase and Alpha Vantage API.
	\subsection{Reuseability}
	The modules of the program must be reusable to make it easy to extend and enhance this application in future versions.
	\subsection{Robustness}
	The main reason for crashes in the application could be change in syntax and functionality of Firebase or Alpha Vantage API. Developers must keep this fact in mind and expect such changes. User's data must not be affected in such situations and the program must not give any output that is not easy to understand for a common user.
	\subsection{Usability}
	The application's functions and user interface must be designed while keeping in mind that most of the end users would be common people who may not have much technical expertise and just want to learn stock trading. As such the application must be very simple, easy to use, and intuitive.
